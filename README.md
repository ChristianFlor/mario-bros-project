# mario-bros-project
It seeks to develop a program that simulates the classic game of Mario Bros. This is composed of several levels, enemies and special powers with which the player can interact. The game revolves around the main character, Mario, and its main controls are jumping, going down the pipes and moving forward and backward (making the screen move with it). For this project, it is thought that the game has 3 levels, each one with the full functionalities, and that at least 1 contains an "extra scenario" that can be reached in some way.
