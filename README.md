# mario-bros-project
Our aim is to develop a program that simulates the classic game of Mario Bros. It is composed of several levels, enemies and special powers that the player can interact with. The game revolves around the main character, Mario, and his main controls are jumping, going down pipes and moving forwards and backwards (making the screen move with him). For this class project, the game has 3 levels, each one with all the functionalities explained before also we expect that at least 1 level contains an "extra scenario" that can be reached in some way.
